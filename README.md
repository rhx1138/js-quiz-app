## A simple quiz app ##

The quiz app is built to help beginning coders learn the fundamentals. 

* Users will have to answer multiple choice questions within a certain amount of time.
* If the answers are incorrect, the 5 seconds will be deducted from their alloted time.
* The user's score will be the amount of time left at the end of their turn.
* Future versions of the quiz app will allow them to save their scores to local storage.
